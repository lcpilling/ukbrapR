# ukbrapR v0.2.0 (20 July 2024)

This is a major update as I move away from using Spark as the default environment, mostly due to the cost implications; it is significantly cheaper (and quicker!) to store and search exported raw text files in the RAP persistant storage than do everything in a Spark environment (plus added benefit of RStudio interface in "normal" instances). 

The Spark functionality remains as before, but all updates are to improve functionality in "normal" instances using RStudio, as we move to the new era of RAP-only UK Biobank analysis.

To make it absolutely clear: the Spark version of `get_emr()` has not been updated. I no longer recommend doing things this way. If you want to submit Pull Requests to improve functions please do. The below changes are to substantially improve the experience of using exported tables in the RAP environment only (if you have all the data on a local system already it will work, assuming you format correctly and provide the paths, but the RAP is the future).

### Changes
 - Added internal data frame containing default paths for exported files in a RAP project (view with `ukbrapR:::ukbrapr_paths`)
 - Added function `export_tables()` which only needs to be run once when a new project is created. This submits the required table exporter commands to extract each of the tables in `ukbrapR:::ukbrapr_paths`. This can take ~15 minutes to export all the tables. ~10Gb of text files are created. This will cost ~Â£0.15 per month to store in the RAP standard storage.
 - Added functionality for `hesin_oper` (HES OPCS operations) searching for ICD10 codes in `get_emr()`
 - Added functionality for `cancer_registry` (cancer registry) searching for ICD10 codes in `get_emr()`
 - `get_df()` now also identifies date of first in matched `cancer_registry` and `hesin_oper` entries, in addition to `hes_diag`, `gp_clinical`, `death_cause` and `selfrep_illness` as before.
 - When getting "date first" using `get_df()` the baseline data is used to create binary case/control variables (for ever and prevalent), and for controls the censoring date is included in the overall `_df` variable (default is 30-10-2022).


# ukbrapR v0.1.6 (03 July 2024)

### Bug fixes
 - Fix `get_df()` error when ascertaining GP diagnoses if 7-character codes were provided rather than 5

### Changes
 - `get_emr()` now accepts option "file_paths" - if not provided, attempts to get from Spark
 - Improve documentation and examples


# ukbrapR v0.1.5 (01 July 2024)

### Bug fixes
 - Fix `get_df()` error occurring when not all sources are desired

### Changes
 - `get_emr_local()` option "local_paths" is now "file_paths"
 - Improve documentation and examples


# ukbrapR v0.1.4 (12 June 2024)

### Bug fixes
 - Fix problem identifying ICD10 column name in RAP HESIN
 - Fix problem getting date first for GP data (excluding missing dates before summarizing)


# ukbrapR v0.1.3 (8 June 2024)

### New feature
- It is quicker/easier to ascertain multiple conditions at once to supply `get_emr()` with all the codes (as before), but now can use `get_df()` with option "group_by" to indicate the condition names in the `codes_df` object provided. See documentation.

### Changes 
- It is no longer possible to provide custom names for the `codes_df` to `get_emr()` -- these now must be `vocab_id` and `code` -- makes things much simpler.
- Remove ICD9 code from `codes_df_hh` example as these are not currently used


# ukbrapR v0.1.2 (6 June 2024)

### New features
- New function `get_emr_local()`. If the user has text files for `hesin_diag` and `gp_clinical` etc. these can be searched (rather than Apache Spark queries). This therefore can work on "normal" DNAnexus nodes, or local servers. Most downstream functions also do not rely on Spark clusters if data extracts are available.

### Changes
- Change URL to reflect my GitHub username change from `lukepilling` to `lcpilling` to be more consistent between different logins, websites, and social media
 -- https://lcpilling.github.io/ukbrapR
 -- https://github.com/lcpilling/ukbrapR
- Added dependency {cli} for improved alert/error reporting


# ukbrapR v0.1.1 (6 March 2024)

### New features
 - New argument "prefix" for `get_df()` - user can provide a string to prefix to the output variable names


# ukbrapR v0.1.0 (21 Feb 2024)

### New features
 - `get_selfrep_illness()` - gets illness information from self-report fields. Derives a "date first" from the age/year reported, incorporating all visits for the participant
 - Two example code lists are incuded: `codes_df_ckd` (GEMINI CKD), and `codes_df_hh` (haemochromatosis, with self-report)

### Changes 
 - `get_emr_df()` is re-named `get_df()` to reflect it can now include information from self-reported illness
 - `get_emr_diagnoses()` is re-named `get_emr()` to reflect it actually retrieves any record in `gp_clinical` not just diagnoses (e.g., BMI if appropriate codes provided)

### Bug fixes
 - So many


# ukbrapR v0.0.2 (14 Nov 2023)

### New features
 - `get_emr_diagnoses()` - function to get electronic medical records diagnoses from Spark-based death records, hospital episode statistics, and primary care (GP) databases.
 - `get_emr_df()` - function to get date first diagnosed with any provided code from any above Electronic Medical Record source.

### Bug fixes
 - Extra input checking in `get_rap_phenos()` and output more consistent for direct use with `get_emr_*()` functions
 - Updated URL for example CKD clinical codes


# ukbrapR v0.0.1 (26 Oct 2023)

Initial release containing two functions:
 - `get_rap_phenos()`
 - `upload_to_rap()`
